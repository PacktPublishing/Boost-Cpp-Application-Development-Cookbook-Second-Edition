# Boost C++ Application Development Cookbook - Second Edition
This is the code repository for [Boost C++ Application Development Cookbook - Second Edition](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/boost-c-application-development-cookbook-second-edition?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787282247), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
Beginning with the basics of Boost C++, you will move on to learn how the Boost libraries simplify application development. You will learn to convert data such as string to numbers, numbers to string, numbers to numbers and more. Managing resources will become a piece of cake. You’ll see what kind of work can be done at compile time and what Boost containers can do. You will learn everything for the development of high quality fast and portable applications. Write a program once and then you can use it on Linux, Windows, MacOS, Android operating systems. From manipulating images to graphs, directories, timers, files, networking – everyone will find an interesting topic.


## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
#include <boost/program_options.hpp>
#include <iostream>
namespace opt = boost::program_options;
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
```

You need a modern C++ compiler, Boost libraries (any version will be OK, 1.65 or a more recent version is recommended), and QtCreator/qmake, or just navigate to http://apolukhin.github.io/Boost-Cookbook/ to run and experiment with examples online.
